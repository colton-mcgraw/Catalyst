# stb_image, fetched at a pinned commit and exposed as the INTERFACE target `catalyst_stb`.
#
# stb is a set of single-file headers with no build system of its own, so there is nothing to
# compile here: the target carries an include directory and the handful of configuration macros the
# implementation and the callers must agree on. The one translation unit that stamps out the
# implementation is src/resource/detail/stb_image_impl.cpp.
#
# The commit is pinned rather than tracking master because stb has no releases: a floating ref would
# mean a decoder that changes under the project without a commit in it to point at. Re-pinning is a
# deliberate edit to the SHA below.
#
# License: stb is dual-licensed public domain (Unlicense) / MIT -- see the LICENSE file in the
# fetched source tree. Catalyst itself remains MIT.
