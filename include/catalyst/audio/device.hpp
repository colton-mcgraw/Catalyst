/**
 * @file device.hpp
 * @brief Enumerating audio endpoints, and saying which one a stream should open.
 * @details Enumeration is a free function rather than a member, because a program that has not
 * decided what to open yet has nothing to call a member on. Populating a device picker is
 * `audio::devices()`, and it costs no stream, no thread and no open handle.
 *
 * The interesting type here is @ref device_selector. The old surface had a single
 * `std::string preferred_device` documented as "an id, or a friendly name as a fallback for
 * convenience, but ambiguous" - which is a field that does two things and tells the caller to hope.
 * Two identical headsets have the same friendly name, so "Headphones" is a coin toss, and there is
 * no way to write "the default device, whatever it is" except by leaving the field empty and
 * knowing that means default. A selector says which question is being asked, and @ref
 * device_selector::by_id is the one to build a settings file on.
