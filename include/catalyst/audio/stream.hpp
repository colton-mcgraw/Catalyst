/**
 * @file stream.hpp
 * @brief An open audio device: what to ask for, what was negotiated, how it is doing, and the
 * object itself.
 * @details A @ref stream is opened by a factory that returns one only on success, so a stream that
 * exists is a stream that is open. That is the whole reason the old `initialize()` / `shutdown()`
 * pair is gone, and with it `is_initialized()`, `not_initialized` and `already_initialized`: three
 * error codes and a query that existed only to describe an object that had been constructed but did
 * not yet mean anything. Now the constructor is the negotiation, the destructor is the close, and
 * the states a caller can observe are the two that matter - open, and open and running.
 *
 * A stream is moveable and not copyable. Moving it is safe at any time, including while running.
 *
 * The threads involved, because two of them are not the caller's:
 *
 *   - **The caller's thread** opens, starts, stops and pumps. None of those are safe to call
 *     concurrently on the same stream; drive one stream from one thread.
 *   - **The driver's render thread** calls the @ref renderer, and nothing else. It is created by
 *     @ref start and joined by @ref stop.
 *   - **A platform notification thread** observes devices appearing and disappearing. It only ever
 *     pushes onto an internal queue; @ref pump drains it onto the caller's bus, on the caller's
 *     thread. See events.hpp.
