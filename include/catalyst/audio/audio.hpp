/**
 * @namespace catalyst::audio
 * @brief Audio devices and the real-time thread that feeds them.
 * @details A program opens a @ref catalyst::audio::stream against a device, hands it a
 * @ref catalyst::audio::renderer, and starts it. From then on the driver calls the renderer on its
 * own thread, once per block, under a hard deadline - that thread and its rules are the module's
 * defining constraint, and block.hpp states them.
 *
 * Everything else exists to keep that thread simple. Devices are enumerated by free functions
 * before anything is open. Failures are @ref catalyst::audio::error values rather than exceptions,
 * because losing a device is ordinary. Device topology changes are queued as they happen and
 * published to a `catalyst::events::bus` from `pump()`, on the caller's thread, so no listener ever
 * runs somewhere surprising. And @ref catalyst::audio::offline_stream renders the same code with no
 * hardware at all, one block at a time, on the calling thread - which is what makes the audio path
 * testable in CI.
 *
 *     auto render = [&synth](audio::render_block &block) noexcept { synth.fill(block); };
 *
 *     audio::stream_config cfg;
 *     cfg.sample_rate = 48000;
 *     cfg.output_channels = 2;
 *
 *     auto stream = audio::stream::open(cfg, render);
 *     if (!stream)
 *     {
 *         log::critical("{}", stream.error());
 *         return;
