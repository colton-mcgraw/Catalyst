/**
 * @file block.hpp
 * @brief One block of audio, and the callable a stream renders it with.
 * @details These two types are the real-time boundary of the module. Everything on the other side
 * of it - opening devices, enumerating endpoints, publishing events - happens on threads the caller
 * owns. Everything on this side happens on a thread the driver owns, under a hard deadline, and the
 * rules are not stylistic:
 *
 * **A renderer must not allocate, lock, block, or do I/O.** No `new`, no `std::vector` growth, no
 * `std::mutex`, no file or socket, no logging, and nothing that might page. Missing the deadline
 * does not produce a slow frame the way it would on the render thread - it produces an audible
 * click, counted as an xrun in @ref stream_stats. A renderer that needs to talk to the rest of the
 * program does it through a lock-free queue it owns, not by reaching back into the engine.
 *
 * **A renderer must not throw.** @ref renderer only accepts callables declared `noexcept`, and that
 * is a hard requirement rather than advice: there is no safe way to unwind out of a driver
 * callback, so the constraint is checked at compile time instead of hoped for at run time.
 *
 * **A renderer must not outlive nothing, and must not be outlived.** @ref renderer is a
 * non-owning reference - two pointers, no allocation - so the callable it names has to stay alive
 * and at a fixed address for as long as the stream does. That was already true of the old
 * `void *user` state pointer; the difference is that it is now the type saying so, and that
 * binding a temporary is a compile error rather than a dangling pointer discovered at 48 kHz.
