/**
 * @file backend.hpp
 * @brief Which platform audio APIs this build can drive, and how to ask.
 * @details A backend is the module's adapter onto one platform API - WASAPI, ASIO, and the two
 * hardware-free ones. Which are compiled in is a build-time decision, which are usable is a
 * run-time one, and both are answered here by free functions rather than by statics hanging off a
 * stream class: asking what this machine can do should not require opening a device first.
 *
 * @ref backend_kind::automatic is a request, not a backend. It resolves at open time to whatever
 * @ref default_backend returns, and never to @ref backend_kind::offline - a stream with no clock of
 * its own is never what a caller who did not name it meant.
