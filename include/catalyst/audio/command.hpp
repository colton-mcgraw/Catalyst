/**
 * @file command.hpp
 * @brief A change to be applied on the render thread, and the ring that carries a queue of them
 * there from the thread that decided on it.
 * @details A game thread cannot touch what a renderer is reading. Not because of a convention, but
 * because the only tools that would make it safe - a mutex, a `shared_ptr` copy, an allocation -
 * are the three things block.hpp forbids on the render thread. So the change travels instead: the
 * game thread describes what it wants done, the render thread does it at a moment of its choosing,
 * between blocks, where nothing is half-written.
 *
 * That is what a @ref command is. It captures its arguments by value into a fixed-size payload,
 * crosses an @ref spsc_ring, and runs on the other side:
 *
 *     // game thread
 *     commands.post([&mixer, voice, gain]() noexcept { mixer.set_gain(voice, gain); });
 *
 *     // render thread, at the top of the block
 *     commands.execute();
 *
 * **A command owns its captures; @ref renderer does not.** The two look alike and are opposites, so
 * it is worth being explicit. `renderer` refers to a callable that must outlive the stream, and
 * binding a temporary to it is a compile error. A command is posted, sits in a ring for an unknown
 * number of milliseconds and runs later - so it copies. That is exactly why a temporary lambda is
 * the *right* way to write one, and why the capture list may not contain a reference to anything
 * that could go away first.
 *
 * **The payload is small, trivially copyable and trivially destructible, and that is enforced.**
 * Small because a ring of commands is preallocated and a command is copied twice; trivially
 * copyable because it crosses to another thread as bytes; trivially destructible because the render
 * thread runs it and then forgets it - running a destructor there is how a `shared_ptr` capture
 * ends up calling `free` at 48 kHz. A capture that does not fit these rules fails to compile, which
 * is the point: the alternative is a click nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * **Ownership travels back the same way.** When a command hands the render thread something to
 * replace - a buffer, a graph node - the old one must not be freed there. It goes into a second
 * ring pointing the other way, and the game thread drains that one and destroys what it finds. The
 * two directions are two @ref command_ring objects; there is no separate type for the return path,
 * because it is the same mechanism with the threads swapped.

     * - not `noexcept`: there is nothing above a driver callback to catch what it throws.
     * - not trivially copyable: it cannot be moved to another thread as bytes.
     * - not trivially destructible: destroying it on the render thread would run arbitrary code -
     *   a `shared_ptr` release, a `std::string` free - under a deadline.
     * - too large: it would not fit the preallocated slot, and growing the slot slows every
     *   command to pay for one.
     *
     * A lambda capturing handles, numbers, and raw pointers to things that outlive the post
