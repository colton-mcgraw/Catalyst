/**
 * @file sound.hpp
 * @brief Decoded audio held in memory, and the handle a mixer knows it by.
 * @details A @ref sound_buffer is the simplest thing in the module: samples, a rate, a channel
 * count, and nothing else. It is deliberately not a resource, not reference-counted and not aware
 * of the mixer. Everything that makes a sound *play* - where it is up to, how loud, how it is
 * panned - belongs to a voice, because two voices playing the same sound must not share any of it.
 *
 * The buffer is interleaved 32-bit float at whatever rate it was decoded at, which need not be the
 * rate the device is running. A voice reconciles the two when it plays; see mixer.hpp.
 *
 * Decoders arrive in a later part of Tier 2 and will produce exactly this type, so nothing that
 * consumes a `sound_buffer` today has to change when a WAV file becomes a way to get one.
