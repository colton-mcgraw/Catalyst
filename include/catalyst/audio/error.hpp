/**
 * @file error.hpp
 * @brief The failure value every fallible audio operation returns through `std::expected`.
 * @details Losing a device to a driver update, or being handed one another process already holds
 * exclusively, is an ordinary outcome for a program that talks to sound hardware - not an
 * exceptional one - so failures are values here, the way `resource::json` reports malformed input.
 *
 * An @ref error is a code plus the little that makes the code actionable. The code alone is enough
 * to branch on; the rest is what a log line needs to be worth reading. `format_unsupported` is the
 * case that motivated the struct: knowing the device refused is useless, and knowing it refused
 * 48000/2 and offers 44100/2 tells the caller exactly what to ask for next. Nothing in here
 * allocates, so an @ref error costs the same to return as the bare enum did.
 *
 * Three codes from the old surface are gone rather than renamed, and their absence is the point:
 * `not_initialized` and `already_initialized` cannot happen now that a stream is opened by a
 * factory that returns one only on success, and `unsupported_operation` no longer covers "you
 * called `render()` on a live stream" because @ref offline_stream is a separate type. What remains
 * of `unsupported_operation` is the honest case: a backend that cannot serve a configuration it
 * otherwise understands.
