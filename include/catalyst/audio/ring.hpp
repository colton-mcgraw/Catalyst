/**
 * @file ring.hpp
 * @brief The lock-free bounded queue one thread writes and one thread reads, which is how anything
 * reaches the render thread without a mutex.
 * @details block.hpp states the rule this header exists to make keepable: *a renderer that needs to
 * talk to the rest of the program does it through a lock-free queue it owns*. This is that queue.
 *
 * Single producer, single consumer, and both halves are the point. A ring with one writer and one
 * reader needs no compare-exchange and no retry loop: the producer owns the write index and the
 * consumer owns the read index, each publishes its own with a release store, and each reads the
 * other's with an acquire load. Every operation completes in a bounded number of instructions with
 * no possibility of spinning, which is what "real-time safe" has to mean on a thread that has
 * roughly a millisecond to produce a block. Two threads pushing, or two popping, is undefined -
 * that is the trade that buys the guarantee.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because each is a decision and not an accident:
 *
 * **Capacity is fixed at construction.** The buffer is allocated once, by whichever thread built
 * the ring, and never again. A ring that grew would allocate on whichever thread happened to fill
 * it, which on the render thread is the failure this type exists to prevent.
 *
 * **A full ring refuses the new item rather than dropping the old one.** @ref notice_queue drops
 * the oldest, because for device topology the newest state is the only one worth having. A ring
 * carrying commands is the opposite: applying "set gain" while silently discarding the "stop voice"
 * that preceded it produces a state nothing asked for. Refusing is visible - `try_push` returns
 * false - and the caller decides.
 *
 * **Nothing here throws.** Every operation after construction is `noexcept`, and the element type
 * must be nothrow-movable and nothrow-destructible, so there is no path from a queue operation to
 * an exception on a thread that cannot unwind.
 *
 * The type is generic because more than one thing needs it - commands going one way, retired
 * buffers coming back the other - and it lives in `catalyst::audio` because audio is what needs it
 * today. Nothing about it is audio-specific; if a second module ever wants it, it moves to
 * `catalyst::utils` unchanged.

     * costs an element.

     * Neither copyable nor movable: it contains the atomics two threads are reading, so relocating
     * one while it is in use would move the memory out from under them. Hold it by value in the
