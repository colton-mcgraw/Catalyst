/**
 * @file offline.hpp
 * @brief A stream with no hardware, no threads, and a clock the caller turns by hand.
 * @details This is how the audio path is tested. Ask for exactly 48000 frames and you get exactly
 * 48000 frames, on the calling thread, with no device to renegotiate the format and no scheduler to
 * decide when. The same @ref renderer runs here and on a real device, so what CI checks is the code
 * that will actually play.
 *
 * It is a separate type from @ref stream, rather than a backend of it, because the two do not have
 * the same operations. The old surface put `render()` and `captured_output()` on the engine and had
 * them fail with `unsupported_operation` on the four backends out of six that own their own clock -
 * so the type's signature promised something four-sixths of its instances could not do. Splitting
 * them deleted that error code's largest use, and each type is now honest about what it is: a
 * @ref stream is clocked by a device and has @ref stream::start and @ref stream::stop; an
 * @ref offline_stream is clocked by @ref offline_stream::render and has neither, because "started"
 * meant nothing for a thing that only ever moves when told to.
 *
 * Capture is likewise explicit. Where the old backend wrote a WAV during `shutdown()` if a path had
 * been set and retention happened to be on - best effort, no way to report failure, in a `noexcept`
 * teardown - @ref offline_stream::write_wav is a call that says what it did.
