/**
 * @file scan.hpp
 * @brief Byte scanners shared by every text format Catalyst parses: finding the next byte from a
 * caller-chosen stop set, and skipping whitespace.
 * @details Every delimited text format has the same inner loop -- run forward over ordinary bytes
 * until one of a handful of interesting ones shows up -- and differs only in which bytes are
 * interesting. JSON string bodies stop at `"`, `\` or a control byte; a CSV field stops at `,`, `"`,
 * CR or LF. Writing that loop once per format means writing the SWAR masks once per format, and
 * those are exactly the lines that are easy to get subtly wrong and hard to notice.
 *
 * So the stop set is a template parameter and the loop is written once. @ref scalar is the obvious
 * byte-at-a-time reference; @ref swar is the production fast path that tests eight bytes per
 * iteration with ordinary 64-bit arithmetic. They must agree on every input for every stop set,
 * which `tests/text/test_scan.cpp` pins differentially.
 *
 * Both are total on their input: a `from` past the end returns `from`, and neither ever reads past
 * `s.size()`, so they are safe on a bare buffer with no sentinel.
 * License: MIT (see LICENSE).
