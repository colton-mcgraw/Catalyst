 * @brief What the rendering module tells the rest of the program about, published on a
 * `catalyst::events::bus`.
 * @details Rendering was the last subsystem that told the application nothing. That mattered more
 * here than it did in audio, because the two things a renderer must report - the device went away,
 * and the swapchain no longer matches its window - are not failures of any one call. They are
 * facts about the world that invalidate work already in flight, and a `bool` returned from
 * whichever call happened to notice first is the wrong shape for them entirely.
 *
 * So both are published *and* returned: `swapchain::acquire` still fails with
 * @ref error_code::swapchain_out_of_date so the caller who is mid-frame can act immediately, and
 * @ref swapchain_out_of_date_event still reaches the bus so the parts of the program that are not
 * in the frame loop - a screenshot task, a UI that caches render targets - hear about it too. The
 * error is for the caller; the event is for everyone else.
 *
 * **Which thread.** Nothing here is published from a driver thread. Backends push onto an internal
 * queue as they observe things, and `device::pump()` drains it onto the bus from whichever thread
 * the caller drives the device from, exactly as `audio::stream::pump()` does. A listener added with
 * `bus.add_listener<...>` therefore runs on the caller's thread and may do anything an ordinary
 * function may do, including destroying and rebuilding the device it just heard about.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is that events are as timely as `pump()` is frequent. A program that
 * calls it once a frame learns about a lost device within a frame; a program that never calls it
 * learns nothing, and its queue is bounded and drops the oldest rather than growing.
