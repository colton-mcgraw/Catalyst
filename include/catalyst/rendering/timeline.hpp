 * @brief `timeline_point`: a value naming a moment on a device queue's timeline, returned by
 * everything that costs GPU time.
 * @details This is the type the rest of the rewrite is built on, so it is worth saying plainly what
 * it is for. Before it, the rendering API had no way to talk about time. `submit` returned a
 * `bool` - the driver accepted the work, nothing more - and the only way to find out whether the
 * GPU had finished anything was `wait_idle`, which stalls everything on the device. So a caller who
 * wanted to reuse a command list, free a staging buffer, or read back a render target had exactly
 * one tool, and it was the biggest hammer in the box.
 *
 * A @ref timeline_point closes that gap. It names the moment a particular submission completes, and
 * it can be:
 *
 *   - **asked** - @ref timeline_point::is_complete, which never blocks;
 *   - **waited on by the CPU** - @ref timeline_point::wait, or @ref timeline_point::wait_for with a
 *     deadline;
 *   - **waited on by the GPU** - hand it to another `submit` as a dependency and the CPU is not
 *     involved at all, which is how work on the copy queue is ordered before work on the graphics
 *     queue without a round trip;
 *   - **awaited** - `co_await` it inside a `catalyst::events::task`, resuming in @ref pump on the
 *     thread that calls it.
 *
 * **Why one type covers three backends.** A Vulkan timeline semaphore, a D3D12 fence and a Metal
 * shared event are the same object: a 64-bit counter that only ever increases, which a submission
 * signals and a wait compares against. Binary semaphores, which are none of those things, appear
 * only in swapchain interop and stay inside the backend where they belong. So `timeline_point` is
 * not an abstraction over three different synchronisation models - it is the one model all three
 * already implement.
 *
 * **Ordering.** Points from the same device queue are totally ordered, and `a <= b` means "a
 * completes no later than b". Points from different queues are not ordered at all, because nothing
 * about the hardware says which of two engines reaches its next milestone first; comparing them
 * yields `std::partial_ordering::unordered` rather than a plausible-looking lie. Use
 * @ref same_timeline when a caller needs to know before comparing.
 *
 * **Threads.** @ref timeline_point::is_complete, @ref timeline_point::wait and
 * @ref timeline_point::wait_for may be called from any thread. Everything else on a device is still
 * single-threaded until Tier 3; see device.hpp.
