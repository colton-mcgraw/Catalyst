 * @brief `frame_ring`: N frames in flight, the command pools that belong to each of them, and the
 * one call in a frame loop that is allowed to block.
 * @details Every renderer needs the same piece of bookkeeping and every renderer writes it again:
 * keep N sets of per-frame GPU state, hand out set `i % N` each frame, and before reusing set `i`
 * make sure the GPU has finished with the frame that used it N frames ago. Getting it wrong is
 * either a corrupted frame (reused too early) or a stalled one (waited too long), and the version
 * that came before this one had neither - it had *one* command list and a hidden wait inside
 * `begin_recording`, which is the same thing as `frames_in_flight = 1`.
 *
 * So this is that ring, made explicit:
 *
 *   - @ref frame_ring::begin **blocks**, and is the only call in the loop that does. It waits for
 *     the frame `frames_in_flight` frames back, then resets that frame's pools so every list from
 *     them may be recorded again. The name says "begin"; the documentation says "waits"; nothing is
 *     hidden anywhere else.
 *   - @ref frame::pool hands out a @ref command_pool per *worker* and per @ref queue_kind. Worker
 *     `i` takes pool `i` and records on its own thread, touching nothing another worker touches.
 *     That is the whole of the thread-safety argument for parallel recording, and it is structural:
 *     there is no shared mutable state on that path to protect.
 *   - @ref frame::end takes the @ref timeline_point the frame's work was submitted at. That point
 *     is what `begin` will wait on when this slot comes round again.
 *
 * **Why the pool is per (worker, kind) and not just per worker.** A pool belongs to a queue family,
 * which Tier 2 established is hardware and not convention - a list recorded from a graphics-family
 * pool cannot be submitted to the copy queue at all. So a worker that records both a draw list and
 * a copy list needs two pools, and the ring makes all three kinds available rather than making the
 * caller predict which it will want. Pools it is never asked for cost one driver object each.
 *
 * @code
 *   auto frames = frame_ring::create(dev, {.frames_in_flight = 3}).value();
 *
 *   while (running)
 *   {
 *       pump(dev);
 *
 *       auto f = frames.begin();                  // waits for frame N-3, resets its pools
 *       if (!f)
 *           break;                                // device lost
 *
 *       command_list cl = create_command_list(f->pool(), "frame");  // or keep one per slot
 *       begin_recording(cl);
 *       // ... record ...
 *       end_recording(cl);
 *
 *       const timeline_point done = submit(get_queue(dev), cl).value();
 *       f->end(done);
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Threads.** The ring itself belongs to one thread: `begin` and `end` are called from the thread
 * that drives the frame loop. What may leave that thread is the @ref command_pool a `frame` hands
 * out - pass pool `i` to worker `i` and let it record there, then join before submitting. See
 * command.hpp for the rules a pool imposes on its thread.
