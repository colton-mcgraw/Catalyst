 * @brief The rendering device: the root object that owns every other GPU resource (buffers, shaders, textures,
 * pipelines, swapchains, command lists) and represents one logical connection to a graphics adapter.
 *
 * @details **Threads.** From Tier 3 on, the module is safe to use from several threads at once, and
 * the rules are worth stating precisely because "thread-safe" on its own says nothing useful:
 *
 *   - **Creating and destroying resources** may be done from any thread, including while other
 *     threads are recording. The registry underneath is guarded; the calls serialise against each
 *     other, so a loader thread creating a thousand buffers is not free, but it is defined.
 *   - **Recording** belongs to whichever thread owns the `command_pool` a list came from - see
 *     command.hpp. N pools, N threads, no contention between them.
 *   - **`submit`** may be called from any thread and is serialised internally. Submissions to one
 *     queue execute in the order they were accepted; two threads submitting to the same queue at
 *     the same time get an unspecified order between them, which is why the usual shape is N
 *     workers recording and one thread submitting.
 *   - **Waiting and querying** - `timeline_point::is_complete`, `wait`, `wait_for`, `completed` -
 *     are safe from any thread and do not hold the module's lock while they block.
 *   - **`pump`** belongs to whichever thread the application picks, and must be the same one every
 *     time: it is where parked coroutines resume, and they have every right to expect a stable
 *     thread. Same bargain as `audio::stream::pump`.
 *   - **`destroy_device`** must not race anything else on that device. It tears down every handle
 *     created from it, so there is nothing left for another thread to be holding.
