 * @brief Asynchronous transfers: `transfer_batch` for getting data onto the GPU, `readback` for
 * getting it off, and the staging ring both are drawn from.
 * @details This is the tier that removes the module's largest hidden stall. Writing to a GPU-only
 * buffer used to mean: copy into a staging buffer, submit a command buffer, and *wait on a fence
 * before returning to the caller*. One texture upload in the middle of a frame therefore drained
 * the queue, and loading a level was N such round trips in series. The API had no way to say so,
 * because it had no way to talk about time at all - which is what Tier 2 fixed and what this tier
 * spends.
 *
 * What replaces it:
 *
 *   - **A staging ring, not a staging buffer.** One host-visible allocation, sized by
 *     `device_desc::staging_ring_bytes`, carved up front-to-back and recycled behind the copy
 *     queue's timeline. Successive transfers overlap instead of taking turns. When the ring is full
 *     of data the GPU has not read yet, the transfer fails with @ref error_code::staging_exhausted
 *     rather than quietly blocking - back-pressure a caller can see and respond to.
 *   - **A batch, not a submission per copy.** @ref transfer_batch accumulates any number of uploads
 *     and submits them once. Loading a level is one `vkQueueSubmit`, not one per mesh.
 *   - **A @ref timeline_point, not a wait.** `submit` hands back the point the data becomes
 *     resident at. `co_await` it, hand it to another `submit` as a GPU-side dependency, or ignore
 *     it - see the ordering note below.
 *
 * **Ordering is automatic, and cheap.** Transfers run on the copy queue, which has no order
 * relative to the graphics or compute queues unless one is imposed. Rather than make every caller
 * remember that, the device records the point of its most recent transfer and every later
 * submission on any queue waits on it - on the GPU, with no CPU involvement, and skipped entirely
 * once the transfer has already completed. So `write_buffer` followed by a draw that reads the
 * buffer is correct with no explicit synchronisation, exactly as it was when the write blocked, and
 * a caller who wants finer ordering than "after all outstanding transfers" gets it by passing the
 * transfer's point to `submit_info::wait` and nothing more.
 *
 * **What still blocks, and why.** `read_buffer` does: it hands back bytes, so it has nowhere to put
 * the waiting. @ref download is the non-blocking form and the one to reach for - it returns a
 * @ref readback that can be polled, waited on, or `co_await`ed.
 *
 * @code
 *   // Streaming a level while the frame loop keeps drawing.
 *   events::task<void> load_level(device dev, level_data data)
 *   {
 *       auto batch = transfer_batch::begin(dev).value();
 *       for (const mesh_data &m : data.meshes)
 *           batch.upload(m.target, 0, m.bytes).value();
 *
 *       const timeline_point resident = batch.submit().value();
 *       co_await resident;                    // resumes inside `pump`, on the caller's thread
 *
 *       logging::info<app>("level resident: {} meshes", data.meshes.size());
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Threads.** A `transfer_batch` belongs to the thread that began it, like a `command_pool` -
 * several threads may each hold their own batch, and they draw from the same ring under the
 * module's own lock. @ref readback may be polled and waited on from any thread.
