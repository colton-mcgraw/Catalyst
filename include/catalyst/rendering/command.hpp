 * @brief Command lists: recorded sequences of GPU work (render passes, state binds, draws, dispatches, copies) that are
 * handed to the device with `submit`.
 * @details Recording is bracketed by `begin_recording` / `end_recording`. Draw calls must sit inside a
 * `begin_render_pass` / `end_render_pass` pair; dispatches and copies must sit outside one. Calls made in an invalid
 * state are ignored by release builds and reported by backends with validation enabled. A command list may be
 * re-submitted until it is re-recorded; re-recording resets it.
 *
 * **Nothing here blocks.** `begin_recording` used to wait for the list's previous submission, because a list cannot be
 * reset while the GPU is still reading it. It no longer does: it *fails* while the list is in flight, and the wait
 * moved to `frame_ring::begin` in frame.hpp, which says out loud that it waits and waits once per frame rather than
 * once per list. A caller who wants the old behaviour writes `last_submission(cl).wait()` and can see what it costs.
 *
 * **Pools own recycling, and pools own threads.** A `command_pool` is created for one @ref queue_kind and is meant to
 * be touched by one thread. Every list allocated from it becomes recordable again when `reset_command_pool` is called,
 * and not before - which is the Vulkan / D3D12 model rather than a Catalyst invention, and the reason N threads can
 * record at once without a lock between them: worker `i` holds pool `i`, and no two pools share a byte.
 * `frame_ring` in frame.hpp is the pool bookkeeping most callers actually want; this header is what it is built from.
 *
 * @code
 *   // One thread, one pool, three lists rotated by hand. (frame_ring does this for you.)
 *   command_pool pool = create_command_pool(dev, {.queue = queue_kind::graphics});
 *   command_list cl   = create_command_list(pool, "frame");
 *
 *   // ... each frame:
 *   last_submission(cl).wait();        // where the GPU has got to with what this pool handed out
 *   reset_command_pool(pool).value();  // now every list from it may be re-recorded
 *   begin_recording(cl);
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Threads.** One thread per `command_pool`, for the pool and for every list allocated from it: create, record,
 * close, reset. Different pools may be driven by different threads at the same time, including pools belonging to the
 * same device and the same queue. `submit` is not thread-affine but is serialised internally, so the usual shape -
 * N workers record, one thread submits what they produced - needs no locking of its own.
 *
 * **Binding model.** Shader resources are bound to numbered slots of four independent kinds - uniform buffers, storage
 * buffers, textures and samplers - and a block of up to `max_push_constant_bytes` inline constants. Textures and
 * samplers are separate objects (as in D3D12 and Metal); combine them in the shader. How a slot appears in shader code:
 *
 * | Call                  | Vulkan (SPIR-V)                | D3D12 (DXIL)      | Metal                 |
 * |-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
 * | `set_uniform_buffer`  | `layout(set = 0, binding = n)` | `register(b<n>)`  | `[[buffer(n)]]`       |
 * | `set_storage_buffer`  | `layout(set = 1, binding = n)` | `register(u<n>)`  | `[[buffer(16 + n)]]`  |
 * | `set_texture`         | `layout(set = 2, binding = n)` | `register(t<n>)`  | `[[texture(n)]]`      |
 * | `set_sampler`         | `layout(set = 3, binding = n)` | `register(s<n>)`  | `[[sampler(n)]]`      |
 * | `push_constants`      | `layout(push_constant)`        | root constants    | `[[buffer(30)]]`      |
 *
 * Bindings are visible to every shader stage and persist across `set_pipeline` calls within a recording. Slot indices
 * are bounded by `max_uniform_buffer_slots`, `max_storage_buffer_slots`, `max_texture_slots` and `max_sampler_slots`.
 *
 * **Coordinate conventions.** Clip space is +Y up with depth in [0, 1] on every backend (the Vulkan backend flips its
 * viewport to match); `viewport` and `scissor_rect` are in framebuffer pixels with the origin at the top-left.
