/**
 * @file registry.hpp
 * @brief The device store: who is connected, what their controls currently read, and the generic events for both.
 * @details This is the module's source of truth. Backends and the platform layer write control values in; `input_state`
 * and the action layer read them out; typed events are published from the same writes. Nothing else keeps a parallel
 * copy of "what is held", which is the bug the old module had - a tracker folding the event stream could and did
 * disagree with the poller that produced it.
 *
 * The registry is deliberately ignorant of what any control *means*. It stores floats, notices when one changes, and
 * publishes `control_changed_event`. Turning that into a `key_event` or a `gamepad_axis_event` is `input::context`'s
 * job, because that is where the semantics live. The split is what keeps this class from growing a branch per device
 * kind, and what lets a device kind nobody has written yet work with no change here at all.
 *
 * Threading: not synchronised. Write from one thread - the one that pumps the platform's messages and calls poll().
 * Reads from other threads need external synchronisation, and a snapshot is usually the better answer anyway.
