/**
 * @file touch.hpp
 * @brief Multi-touch: id-tracked contacts, their phases, and the events that report them.
 * @details A touchscreen is a device whose slots are contacts. Each contact occupies five consecutive slots - x, y,
 * pressure, size, and an "is down" flag - so a pinch gesture is two contacts' worth of ordinary controls and needs
 * nothing special from the binding layer.
 *
 * The `id` on an event is the platform's tracking id and is what identifies *a finger over time*; the `index` is which
 * slot the module assigned it, and is what identifies it in the control model. Slots are recycled once a contact ends,
 * ids are not, so gesture code should follow `id` and only ever read control values by `index`.
