/**
 * @file text.hpp
 * @brief Text entry: committed text, and the in-progress composition an input method shows before it.
 * @details This is deliberately not in keyboard.hpp. Text is not a physical key - what a key produces depends on the
 * layout, the modifiers, and whatever input method is running, and a Japanese IME commits whole strings from a sequence
 * of keys that means nothing on its own. Splitting the two makes room for composition events, which real i18n needs and
 * which have nothing to say about key_code.
 *
 * Text is carried inline as UTF-32 so an event is trivially copyable and never allocates. A platform that commits more
 * than `inline_capacity` code points at once splits it across consecutive events, so a consumer simply appends `text()`
 * to its buffer and never has to reassemble anything.
