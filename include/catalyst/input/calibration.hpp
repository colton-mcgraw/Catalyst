/**
 * @file calibration.hpp
 * @brief Learning a gamepad's dead zone from a controller that is left alone.
 * @details Split out of gamepad.hpp because it is a tool built *on* the gamepad API rather than part of it - the
 * vocabulary header should not carry a state machine, and the old one also carried a blocking version that slept in a
 * loop, which a library core has no business doing.
 *
 * The idea is simple: watch a resting controller, take the largest stick magnitude and trigger value it reports as its
 * noise floor, and put the threshold just above them. That gives every player a dead zone matched to their own
 * hardware instead of one tuned for the worst pad the developer happened to own.
 *
 * The calibrator is fed one frame at a time, so a game runs its normal loop and draws a progress bar while it works:
 *
 *     gamepad_deadzone_calibrator cal(0);
 *     cal.start();                              // the user picked "calibrate"
 *     ...
 *     in.poll();                                // as usual
 *     if (cal.update(in))                       // true once it has rested long enough
 *         in.set_deadzone(cal.result());
 *     draw_progress(cal.progress());
 *
 * Touching anything restarts the window, and `restarts()` is the cue to tell the user to let go.
