/**
 * @file keyboard.hpp
 * @brief Defines the key_code enumeration, which represents physical keys on a keyboard. The key codes are based on the USB HID Keyboard/Keypad usage IDs (usage page 0x07). This file also includes a function to convert key codes to their corresponding USB HID usage IDs. The key_code enumeration allows for consistent representation of keyboard keys across different platforms and input systems, while text entry is delivered separately via character/text input events.
 * @details The key_code enumeration provides a comprehensive list of physical keys on a keyboard, including letters, digits, function keys, and various control keys. Each key code corresponds to a specific physical key, and the values are aligned with the USB HID standard for keyboard input. This allows for consistent handling of keyboard input across different platforms and input systems. The to_usb_hid function provides a convenient way to convert key codes to their corresponding USB HID usage IDs, which can be useful when interfacing with low-level input APIs or when implementing custom input handling logic that requires knowledge of the underlying USB HID usage IDs. Text entry is handled separately through character or text input events, allowing for a clear distinction between physical key presses and the resulting text input, which can be affected by factors such as keyboard layout and modifier keys.

/**
 * @namespace catalyst::input
 * @brief The catalyst::input namespace contains definitions and utilities related to input handling in the Catalyst framework, including keyboard input, mouse input, gamepad input, and other input devices. This namespace provides a consistent interface for handling various types of input across different platforms and input systems, allowing developers to easily manage user interactions in their applications. The key_code enumeration, which represents physical keys on a keyboard, is defined within this namespace, along with functions for converting key codes to USB HID usage IDs and handling text input events separately from physical key presses.
 * @details The catalyst::input namespace is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools and definitions for handling user input in a consistent and efficient manner. By organizing all input-related functionality within this namespace, we can avoid naming conflicts and provide a clear structure for developers to access the various input handling utilities they need for their projects. The key_code enumeration allows for consistent representation of physical keys on a keyboard, while the to_usb_hid function provides a convenient way to convert key codes to their corresponding USB HID usage IDs. Text entry is handled separately through character or text input events, allowing for a clear distinction between physical key presses and the resulting text input, which can be affected by factors such as keyboard layout and modifier keys. This design allows for flexibility in handling different types of input while maintaining a clear and organized structure for developers to work with.
