/**
 * @file event_ring.hpp
 * @brief The bounded queue of events shared by the two hand-off sinks.
 * @details `async_sink` and `queued_sink` differ only in who does the writing - a worker thread the
 * sink started, or the owner asking for its events when it is ready for them. What happens on the
 * logging thread is the same for both: copy the event into a fixed ring, or apply the overflow
 * policy and count what was lost. That part lives here.
 *
 * Nothing in here locks. The ring is a plain data structure; the sink around it owns the mutex,
 * because each of them needs one anyway for the condition variables and counters that are their own
 * business.
