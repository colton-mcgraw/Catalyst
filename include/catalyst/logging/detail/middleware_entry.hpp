/**
 * @file middleware_entry.hpp
 * @brief The router's type-erased view of a registered middleware.
 * @details The same trick as sink_entry: the callable is erased once, at registration, so that
 * everything the router does with the chain afterwards is ordinary code compiled once.
 *
 * Entries are held by `shared_ptr` in a copy-on-write list, which is what makes removal safe without
 * any waiting. Removing a middleware builds a list without it, but a dispatch already running holds
 * a `shared_ptr` to the old list, so both the entry and the callable inside it stay alive until that
 * dispatch is finished with them. The `active` flag is what stops the same dispatch from starting it
 * again on the way through.
 *
 * The chain runner erases itself too. A middleware is called with the event, an opaque context, and
 * a function pointer that resumes the chain from that context - so `next` can be a small object with
 * no idea what a middleware list is, and the runner can live in router.cpp.
