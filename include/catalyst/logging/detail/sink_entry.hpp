/**
 * @file sink_entry.hpp
 * @brief The router's type-erased view of a registered sink, and the state it keeps alongside it.
 * @details The router stores sinks as two `std::function`s and an id, so that everything it does
 * with them - installing, removing, dispatching, flushing - is ordinary code compiled once, and only
 * the erasure itself has to be a template. `make_entry` is that template.
 *
 * Each entry also carries a `sink_control`, held by `shared_ptr` so that it outlives the copy-on-write
 * sink list it was installed into. Three things need somewhere to live that a dispatch already
 * holding a stale snapshot can still reach:
 *
 *   - the lock a `serialized` sink is called under,
 *   - the in-flight count that lets `remove_sink` wait until nobody is inside the sink any more,
 *     which is the only thing that makes registering a sink by reference safe to undo,
 *   - the counters and timings the router reports back.
 *
 * The entry also carries the registration's filter, when it was given one. It sits here rather than
 * in a wrapper around the sink because it is a property of the registration, not of the sink: the
 * same sink registered twice can answer to two different audiences, and a filter that lives in the
 * entry costs the sink type nothing and the router one null check.
