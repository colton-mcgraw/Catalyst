/**
 * @file queued.hpp
 * @brief A sink that holds events until their owner comes to collect them.
 * @details This is the sink a GUI panel is built on, and the only way an `owner_thread` sink reaches
 * a router. `async_sink` moves the writing to *a* thread; `queued_sink` moves it to *the* thread -
 * the one that owns whatever the sink touches, on the schedule that thread chooses.
 *
 *     auto panel = std::make_shared<queued_sink>(std::make_shared<my_gui_sink>());
 *     router.add_sink(panel);
 *
 *     // ... once a frame, on the thread that owns the widgets:
 *     panel->drain();
 *
 * On the logging thread `write` copies the event into a bounded ring and returns; nothing the owner
 * owns is touched, and nothing waits. `drain()` then delivers what accumulated, on the caller's
 * thread, and returns how many events that was. `drain(n)` delivers at most `n`, for an owner that
 * would rather spread a backlog over several frames than spend one of them catching up.
 *
 * The ceiling is real and so `overflow_policy` applies, minus `block`: a logging thread parked until
 * the owner next drains is a stall when the owner is busy and a deadlock when the owner is the
 * thread that logged. Dropped events are counted and reported into the inner sink on the next drain,
 * so a gap in the panel says so.
 *
 * Two things to know:
 *
 *   - A `queued_sink` has no `flush()`, deliberately. Flushing means delivering, delivering means
 *     running the inner sink, and the router flushes from the logging thread - which is the one
 *     thread this sink exists to keep away from the owner's state. So the router will not empty this
 *     queue for you, including on the way out at `fatal`. A panel is for reading the log while the
 *     process is alive; pair it with a console or file sink for the record of the process dying.
 *
 *   - Whatever has not been drained when the `queued_sink` is destroyed is discarded, because the
 *     destructor has no way to know it is running on the owner's thread. Drain first if it matters.
