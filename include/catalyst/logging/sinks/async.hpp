/**
 * @file async.hpp
 * @brief A sink that takes events off the logging thread.
 * @details Every stock sink writes on the thread that logged: `file_sink` takes a lock and pushes a
 * line at the filesystem while the caller waits. That is the wrong trade in a frame loop, where the
 * cost of one slow write lands on whatever was being drawn.
 *
 *     router.emplace_sink<async_sink>(file_sink{"app.log"});
 *
 * `async_sink` wraps any other sink, copies each event into a bounded queue, and lets one worker
 * thread do the writing. What it cannot do is grow without limit, so a producer faster than the
 * sink behind it eventually meets the queue's ceiling, and `overflow_policy` says what happens then.
 * Dropped events are counted and reported into the inner sink, so a gap in the log says so rather
 * than passing for silence.
 *
 * The inner sink is only ever touched by the worker thread, which means it does not have to be
 * thread-safe on its own account - though the stock ones are anyway, since nothing stops the same
 * sink also being registered directly. What it must not be is `owner_thread`: the worker is a thread
 * this sink started, not the one the sink asked for, and wrapping a GUI sink in an `async_sink` would
 * quietly do exactly the thing the contract was written to prevent. Those go in a `queued_sink`,
 * and the constructor here says so.
 *
 * Two ways this sink can still hold up a logging thread, both of them chosen rather than accidental:
 * `overflow_policy::block` waits for room, and `flush()` waits for the worker to catch up - which
 * the router does on its own account at the flush level. `async_options::flush_timeout` puts a
 * ceiling on the second.
