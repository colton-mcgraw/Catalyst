/**
 * @file middleware.hpp
 * @brief The layer an event passes through before any sink sees it.
 * @details Middleware is where an event is inspected, changed, or stopped - once, for the whole
 * router, rather than once per sink. It is the same idea as `catalyst::events` middleware, spelled
 * the same way, because it is the same job: a chain of callables wrapped around the delivery, each
 * free to do something before it, after it, or instead of it.
 *
 * Two forms. The short one answers whether the event should carry on:
 *
 *     router.add_middleware([](log_event &e) { return !e.message.contains(secret); });
 *
 * The long one is handed the rest of the chain and decides when, or whether, to call it - which is
 * what lets middleware do something on the way back out as well:
 *
 *     router.add_middleware([](log_event &e, const next &n)
 *     {
 *         const auto started = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
 *         n(e);
 *         record(std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - started);
 *     });
 *
 * The event is passed by non-const reference, so middleware may rewrite it: redact a password out of
 * a message, put a frame number in the category, attach a payload the sinks downstream know how to
 * read. Everything after it in the chain, and every sink, sees what it left behind.
 *
 * Ordering is by descending priority, and registration order within a priority, so the
 * highest-priority middleware is the outermost layer - the first to see the event and the last to
 * see the chain return. A middleware that drops an event costs the sinks nothing, so a check that
 * discards a lot belongs at a high priority.
 *
 * What middleware must not do is log. It runs inside the dispatch, so an event logged from in there
 * is dropped by the same reentrancy guard that protects the sinks, and counted in
 * `router::dropped_reentrant()`.
 *
 * Middleware is not the level check. Levels are decided before an event is built at all, and this
 * runs after the event exists and its message has been formatted. Turning a whole category off
 * belongs in `router::set_category_level`, which costs nothing per call; middleware is for the
 * decisions that need to look at the event.
