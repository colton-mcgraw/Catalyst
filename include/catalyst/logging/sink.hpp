/**
 * @file sink.hpp
 * @brief What a sink is and what it must promise. The sinks themselves are in sinks/.
 * @details A sink is anything with `void write(const log_event &)` that also states, in its own
 * type, which threads the router may call that from. The statement is not optional: a type with a
 * `write` and no contract is not a sink, and `router::add_sink` says so in as many words. The point
 * is that the decision gets made deliberately, once, by whoever knows what the sink touches - not
 * inferred by the router, which cannot know, and not left to a default, which would be wrong for
 * half of them.
 *
 * There are three contracts, declared as a member or through `sink_contract`:
 *
 *     struct my_sink : sink_contract<sink_threading::serialized>
 *     {
 *         void write(const log_event &event);
 *     };
 *
 *   - `reentrant`    Any thread, any number at once. The sink owns its synchronisation, or has no
 *                    state to synchronise. Every stock sink is one, because each holds its own
 *                    lock. The cheapest contract: the router adds nothing.
 *
 *   - `serialized`   Any thread, one at a time. The router holds a lock of its own around `write`,
 *                    so the sink's state is safe without the sink doing anything about it. This is
 *                    the contract for a sink that was written without threading in mind. It costs
 *                    one uncontended lock per event, and it does not make the sink fast - a slow
 *                    `serialized` sink now blocks the other threads trying to log, as well as the
 *                    one that got there first.
 *
 *   - `owner_thread` One particular thread, which is not the one that logged. A GUI panel that
 *                    touches widgets belongs here. The router refuses to register these directly -
 *                    it has no way to honour the requirement - and `add_sink` fails to compile
 *                    pointing at `queued_sink`, which takes the event on the logging thread and
 *                    hands it over when the owner asks for it.
 *
 * Note what the contract does not say. None of them make a sink safe to be slow: `write` runs on
 * the thread that logged, inside whatever that thread was doing, and a frame loop feels every
 * microsecond of it. A sink that talks to a file, a socket, or a GUI wants `async_sink` or
 * `queued_sink` in front of it, whatever contract it declares.
 *
 * `flush()` is optional; the router calls it when the sink has one.
 *
 * This header is the contract and nothing else, so a type declaring one does not drag in an
 * `<fstream>` or an `<iostream>` it has no use for. The sinks that come with the module are in
 * sinks/, one to a file, and sinks.hpp includes all of them.
