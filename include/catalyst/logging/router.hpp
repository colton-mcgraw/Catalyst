/**
 * @file router.hpp
 * @brief The object that takes every event, runs it through the middleware, and hands it to every sink.
 * @details Sinks are added three ways, depending on who needs to keep hold of them:
 *
 *     add_sink(console_sink{})                        by value; the router owns the copy
 *     add_sink(std::make_shared<ring_buffer_sink>())  shared; the caller reads it later
 *     add_sink(std::ref(my_sink))                     by reference; the caller keeps it alive
 *
 * Each returns a `sink_id` that `remove_sink()` takes back, or wrap the id in a `scoped_sink` (see
 * sink.hpp) to have that happen when the owner goes away - a GUI panel that comes and goes registers
 * its sink for exactly as long as it exists.
 *
 * Whichever way, the sink has to have declared its threading contract (see sink.hpp) and it has to
 * be one the router can honour: a sink that only its own thread may touch cannot be called by a
 * logging thread on any terms, and `add_sink` refuses it at compile time rather than at three in the
 * morning. What the router does with the other two:
 *
 *   - `reentrant`  called directly, from as many threads as are logging.
 *   - `serialized` called under a lock the router keeps for that registration.
 *
 * A registration may also carry a filter, which is how one router feeds several audiences: the
 * console gets everything, a log panel gets info and above, and a subsystem's tab gets only its own
 * category.
 *
 *     add_sink(panel, level_at_least(log_level::info));
 *
 * The filter belongs to the registration rather than to the sink, so the same sink registered twice
 * can answer to two audiences, and a sink type never has to know it is being filtered.
 *
 * Before any of that, an event passes through the middleware chain, which is where it can be
 * changed or stopped for every sink at once - redacting a secret, tagging a frame number, timing the
 * whole dispatch. See middleware.hpp.
 *
 * Levels are decided before a message is formatted, so a trace call that nobody wants costs a load
 * and a compare. There is a minimum for everything and an optional override per category, so
 * "vulkan" can be held at warn while the rest runs at debug. Overrides nest: one set on "physics"
 * covers "physics.solver" as well, and the longest one covering a category wins.
 *
 * Three things the router does so that a sink cannot take the process with it:
 *
 *   - A sink that throws has the exception swallowed and counted, and the next sink still gets the
 *     event. A log call is the last place a caller expects a throw to come from. Middleware is
 *     covered the same way, though a middleware that throws does abandon the event: a chain cannot
 *     be resumed from the middle of a layer that gave up.
 *   - A sink or middleware that logs while it is running would re-enter the router on the same
 *     thread and recurse until the stack ran out. The nested event is dropped instead, and counted;
 *     see `dropped_reentrant()`. Something with a report to make makes it out of band.
 *   - `remove_sink()` does not return until no thread is inside that sink any more, so the moment it
 *     returns is the moment the sink can be destroyed. This is what makes `add_sink(std::ref(...))`
 *     and `scoped_sink` safe for something with a real lifetime, like a panel.
 *
 * The sink list and the middleware chain are both copy-on-write and are called with no router lock
 * held, so either may add or remove registrations - including its own - while it runs. Removing
 * itself from inside its own `write` returns immediately rather than waiting, since it plainly
 * cannot wait for itself. Removing a *different* sink from in there does wait for it, with the one
 * consequence worth naming: two sinks that each remove the other, from inside their own `write`, at
 * the same time, will wait for each other. Nothing else in here can deadlock on a sink.
