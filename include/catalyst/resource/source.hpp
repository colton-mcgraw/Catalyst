 * @brief @ref catalyst::resource::source -- the seam between "a name for some bytes" and the bytes,
 * plus the two implementations every build has: a directory on disk and a table in memory.
 * @details A source answers one question -- *given this URI, what are the bytes?* -- and knows
 * nothing about what the bytes mean. Decoding happens a layer up, in the loaders; mounting and
 * scheme dispatch happens a layer up from here too, in @ref catalyst::resource::vfs. Keeping the
 * three apart is what lets a shipped build read a texture out of a pack file while the editor reads
 * the same URI off the artist's disk, with no loader changing by a line.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately small. `open` is the whole of it; `exists` and `stat` are there
 * because a hot-reload watcher and an editor's asset browser both need to ask about an entry
 * without paying to read it, and `list` because something has to be able to enumerate a pack.
 * There is no seek, no partial read and no write: a source is a read-only, whole-entry thing.
 * Streaming a 2 GB video is not what this is for, and pretending otherwise would put a file handle
 * in every asset.
 *
 * **Threads.** A `source` must be safe to call from several threads at once, because the async read
 * path (see vfs.hpp) will call it from a worker while the main thread calls it too. Both sources
 * here are: the file source holds no mutable state across a call, and the memory source's table is
 * fixed at construction.
