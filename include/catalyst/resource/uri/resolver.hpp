/**
 * @file resolver.hpp
 * @brief The RFC 3986 section 5 and 6 algorithms behind @ref catalyst::resource::uri::resolve and
 * @ref catalyst::resource::uri::normalized.
 * @details These are the two operations a resource system actually needs. An asset manifest that
 * says `../textures/stone_d.png` is only meaningful against the URI the manifest itself came from,
 * which is `resolve`; a texture cache is only correct if two spellings of one URI hash the same,
 * which is `normalized`. Both end by recomposing through @ref catalyst::resource::uri::from_parts,
 * so neither can produce a `uri` whose own text would not reparse. Both are members, so they are
 * declared in reference.hpp with the rest of the class and defined alongside these in resolver.cpp.
