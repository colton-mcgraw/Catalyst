 * a disk it does not control -- not exceptional ones -- so failures are values here, the way
 * `catalyst::rendering`, `catalyst::audio` and the `json` / `csv` / `uri` sub-modules report theirs.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* the same type as @ref catalyst::resource::json::parse_error or
 * @ref catalyst::resource::uri_error. Those describe a byte offset in a document; this describes
 * something that happened to a named asset. When a loader wraps a parse failure, it keeps the
 * document's own message in @ref error::detail and reports @ref error_code::decode_failed, so the
 * caller branches on one enum and still gets the line number in a log.
