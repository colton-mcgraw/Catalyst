 * @brief @ref catalyst::resource::vfs -- the mount table that turns a URI into a
 * @ref catalyst::resource::source and gets the bytes, synchronously or on a worker.
 * @details One `vfs` owns the mounts, and everything above it names assets by URI and nothing else.
 * That indirection is the point of the layer: a shipped build mounts a sealed pack on `asset:`, the
 * editor mounts the artist's working tree on the same scheme, and a test mounts a
 * @ref make_memory_source table -- and the URI in a manifest, a material or a save file is
 * identical in all three.
 *
 * **Resolution.** A mount claims a scheme, optionally narrowed by an authority and a path prefix.
 * Mounts are consulted most-specific first, so `asset://core/` can be a pack while `asset://` at
 * large stays on disk. A relative reference is resolved against @ref vfs::base first, which is how
 * a manifest that says `../textures/stone_d.png` becomes a name the mount table can dispatch; see
 * `uri::resolve`. Names are matched after `uri::normalized`, so two spellings of one asset hit one
 * cache entry.
 *
 * **Async.** @ref vfs::read_async returns an `events::task`. In Tier 1 it completes synchronously
 * on the calling thread -- the seam exists so callers are written against the shape they will get,
 * not so they get it yet. Tier 3 puts a worker pool behind it and the awaiting coroutine resumes on
 * whichever thread pumps it, exactly as `rendering::transfer` already does.
 *
 * **Threads.** Reads are safe from any thread. Mounting is not: build the table during startup,
 * then read from it. A vfs whose mounts change under a concurrent read is a bug this class does not
 * try to make safe, because the alternative is a lock on the hot path for something that happens
 * twice per run.
