 * @brief The @ref catalyst::resource::loader seam and the @ref catalyst::resource::load call it
 * exists to make possible: name an asset, get a counted handle to it, and never write the
 * read-check-decode-insert sequence again.
 * @details Tier 1 left four steps for every asset type: resolve the name, ask the registry whether
 * it is already resident, read the bytes, decode them, insert. Four steps that are identical for
 * every type except the decode. This header is the seam that factors out the other three.
 *
 * **The seam is a trait, not a table.** `loader<T>` is a class template with no primary definition;
 * a type becomes loadable by specialising it. That is deliberately a compile-time registration and
 * not a runtime `register_loader<T>(...)` map:
 *
 *   - There is no global to initialise, so no static initialisation order to get wrong and no
 *     "loader not registered" failure that only happens in the shipped build.
 *   - `load<T>` resolves to a direct call. The registry and the vfs never see a `std::function`,
 *     and the decode is inlinable into the caller.
 *   - Asking for a type with no loader is a compile error naming the type, at the call site, rather
 *     than an `unsupported_format` at run time.
 *
 * The cost is the one thing a runtime table buys: loaders cannot be added by a plugin the
 * application did not compile against. When that is actually needed it is a `loader<T>`
 * specialisation that dispatches on a content type through a table of its own -- a decision that
 * belongs to the one asset type that needs it, not to every type in the system.
 *
 * **What the seam does not know.** Nothing here mentions PNG, JSON or any container. `loader<image>`
 * is specialised in image.hpp, next to the asset type it loads, and @ref registry / @ref vfs do not
 * include this header at all. That direction matters: the mount table's job is bytes, and it stays
 * ignorant of what the bytes are.
 *
 * **A loader may load.** @ref load_context hands a loader the same `vfs` and `store` the call
 * started from, so a material's loader can call `load<image>` for its textures and get the sharing,
 * the counting and the caching for free. Cycle detection for a declared dependency graph is not
 * here; a loader that recurses into itself will recurse forever, and the graph that would prevent
 * it is deferred with the rest of the dependency work. See docs/resource.md.

     * around: an asset that needs loading two ways needs two names. In practice this bites exactly

     * cooked file, not a second cache key.
