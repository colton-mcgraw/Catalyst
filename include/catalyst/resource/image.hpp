 * @brief @ref catalyst::resource::image -- decoded pixels on the CPU, described in the renderer's
 * own vocabulary so that uploading one is a copy and not a translation.
 * @details **There is no `resource::image_format`.** The pixel format is `rendering::format` and the
 * dimensions are `rendering::extent3d`, both re-exported below from `<catalyst/rendering/types.hpp>`.
 * That header is `constexpr` enums and templates only, so using it costs an include path and no
 * link dependency -- see handle.hpp for why that matters and docs/resource.md for the module graph.
 *
 * Defining a parallel `rgba8 | rgb8 | rgba16f | ...` enum here would have meant a translation
 * function, a set of formats the renderer cannot actually sample (`rgb8` is not in any backend's
 * intersection), and two enums to keep in step every time a format is added. The decoder's job is
 * to produce something `create_texture` will take; the honest way to say that is to use the type
 * `create_texture` takes.
 *
 * **Three ways to get one, and they are not interchangeable.**
 *
 *   - @ref load_image over a *source* format -- PNG, JPEG, BMP, TGA, PSD, GIF, PIC, PNM, Radiance
 *     `.hdr` -- decodes through stb_image to a single uncompressed level. This is what an artist's
 *     working tree holds and what the editor reads.
 *   - @ref load_image over a *cooked container* -- KTX2 or DDS -- reads the mip chain, the array
 *     layers and the block-compressed format that were decided when the asset was cooked. stb has
 *     no notion of either container, so these are this module's own readers; they are pure
 *     rearrangement, with no codec behind them, which is why they are in the build even when
 *     `CATALYST_RESOURCE_STB=OFF`.
 *   - @ref generate_mips builds a chain for an image that arrived without one. The run-time answer
 *     to the problem a cooked container solves at build time.
 *
 * All three come back through one `load_image` call, which sniffs the container from its magic
 * number. A caller does not choose a reader.
 *
 * **Block-compressed formats are ordinary here.** An `image` holding BC7 is a normal `image`; what
 * changes is the arithmetic, since a texel has no size and only a 4x4 block does. @ref
 * level_size_bytes and @ref packed_size_bytes are block-aware and are the only correct way to size
 * a level. @ref generate_mips is the one operation that refuses them, because filtering compressed
 * texels means decompressing them.
 *
 * The GPU upload that turns an `image` into a `rendering::texture` remains Tier 3, in the separate
 * `catalyst_resource_gpu` target that *does* link the renderer. See docs/resource.md.

     * @details Thin on purpose: it is @ref load_image and nothing else. The interesting half of
     * loading -- the cache probe, the read, the insertion, the reference the caller ends up owning
     * -- is in @ref load and is the same for every asset type, which is the entire argument for the
     * seam existing.
     *
     * It ignores its @ref load_context. An image has no dependencies; a material will not.
