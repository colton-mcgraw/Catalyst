/**
 * @file parser.hpp
 * @brief The CSV parser: @ref catalyst::resource::csv::parse_table and the scanning it is built on.
 * @details The grammar is RFC 4180 relaxed in the ways real files need it to be -- any of CRLF, LF or
 * a lone CR ends a record, the last record need not be terminated, and the dialect decides about
 * headers, trimming and ragged rows.
 *
 * The inner loop is `catalyst::text::scan`, with the stop set that header predicted for CSV: the
 * delimiter, the quote, CR and LF. Because a delimiter is a runtime value and the scanner's stop set
 * is a template parameter, the parser resolves one function pointer per parse -- a SWAR scan for the
 * delimiters that actually occur in the wild, a scalar loop for anything else. The choice is made
 * once, outside the loop, so the pointer is predictable and the loop stays tight.
