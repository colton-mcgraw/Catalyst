/**
 * @file dialect.hpp
 * @brief The @ref catalyst::resource::csv::dialect knobs that describe a particular flavour of CSV.
 * @details "CSV" names a family, not a format: the delimiter is a comma except when it is a tab or a
 * semicolon, the first record is a header except when it is data, and rows are all the same width
 * except when they are not. Rather than spread those choices across parser and writer overloads,
 * they live in one aggregate that both sides take, so a file read with a dialect writes back out
 * with the same one.
