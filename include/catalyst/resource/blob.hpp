 * @brief @ref catalyst::resource::blob -- the bytes a @ref catalyst::resource::source hands back,
 * and the one place the asset system talks about ownership of raw memory.
 * @details A `blob` is a move-only span of bytes plus the knowledge of how to release them. It
 * exists because the two sources that matter release their bytes differently and a loader should
 * not have to care which it got: a file source allocates and frees, a pack source memory-maps a
 * region it later unmaps, and a future source may hand out a view into an archive it keeps resident
 * with no per-read allocation at all.
 *
 * So `blob` is not `std::vector<std::byte>`. A vector would force the mapped and resident cases to
 * copy, which for a 200 MB texture pack is the whole cost of loading it. The deleter is a plain
 * function pointer and a `void *` rather than a `std::function` so the type stays trivially movable
 * and costs nothing to pass around.
