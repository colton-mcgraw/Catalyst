/**
 * @namespace catalyst::platform
 * @brief The catalyst::platform namespace contains all the platform-specific types and functions provided by the Catalyst Platform library. This includes window management, event handling, and other platform-related utilities. By organizing all platform-specific functionality within this namespace, we can avoid naming conflicts and provide a clear structure for users of the library to access the various platform tools they need for their applications. The Catalyst Platform library is designed to be efficient, easy to use, and compatible with modern C++ standards, making it a valuable resource for developers building real-time applications and games.
 * @details The Catalyst Platform library provides a collection of platform utilities and types commonly used in game development and real-time applications. By including the appropriate headers from the Catalyst Platform library, users can access all the functionality they need for their projects, such as creating windows, handling events, and interacting with the underlying operating system in a platform-agnostic way. This allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of platform-specific code, while still having access to powerful tools for managing windows and events effectively.
