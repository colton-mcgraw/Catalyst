/**

 * @brief Monitor management and event handling for the Catalyst platform library.
 * @details This header defines types and functions related to monitor management and event handling in the Catalyst platform library. It includes definitions for monitor descriptors, monitor events, and functions for retrieving monitor information. The monitor management system allows developers to query connected monitors, their properties, and handle events related to monitor changes (e.g. when a monitor is connected or disconnected). By using the functionality provided in this header, developers can create applications that are responsive to changes in the display environment and can adapt to different monitor configurations effectively.

/**
 * @namespace catalyst::platform
 * @brief The catalyst::platform namespace contains all the platform-specific types and functions provided by the Catalyst Platform library. This includes window management, event handling, and other platform-related utilities. By organizing all platform-specific functionality within this namespace, we can avoid naming conflicts and provide a clear structure for users of the library to access the various platform tools they need for their applications. The Catalyst Platform library is designed to be efficient, easy to use, and compatible with modern C++ standards, making it a valuable resource for developers building real-time applications and games.
 * @details The Catalyst Platform library provides a collection of platform utilities and types commonly used in game development and real-time applications. By including the appropriate headers from the Catalyst Platform library, users can access all the functionality they need for their projects, such as creating windows, handling events, and interacting with the underlying operating system in a platform-agnostic way. This allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of platform-specific code, while still having access to powerful tools for managing windows and events effectively.

Each monitor connected to the system is assigned a unique monitor_id, which can be used to reference and manipulate that specific monitor throughout its lifecycle. The monitor_id is typically implemented as a 64-bit unsigned integer, allowing for a large number of monitors to be managed simultaneously without conflicts.
     * @details The monitor_id type serves as a fundamental building block for the Catalyst Platform library's monitor management system. By using unique identifiers for each monitor, the library can efficiently track and manage multiple monitors, allowing developers to create applications that can adapt to different display configurations and respond to changes in the display environment effectively. The monitor_id can be used in various functions and methods within the library to perform operations on specific monitors, such as retrieving their properties or processing events related to those monitors.
