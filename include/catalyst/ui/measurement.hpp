/**
 * @namespace catalyst::ui
 * @brief The catalyst::ui namespace contains types and functions related to user interface measurements and layout. This includes representations of CSS-like measurements (e.g. lengths with various units), as well as functions for resolving these measurements to pixel values based on a given context (e.g. DPI scale, parent dimensions). By organizing UI-related measurement functionality within this namespace, we can provide a clear structure for users of the library to access and work with UI measurements in a consistent way.
 * @details The measurement types and functions in this namespace are designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing developers to express complex layout requirements using familiar CSS-like units and calculations. The `calc_measure` template provides a way to represent linear combinations of units, while the `length` type defines common CSS length units. The `resolve_or` function can be used to convert these measurements to pixel values based on a provided context, making it easier to implement responsive and adaptive UI layouts.
