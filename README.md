# Catalyst v0.1.0

Catalyst is a high-performance rendering framework for C++ designed to simplify the development of applications. It provides a robust set of features, including 2D and 3D rendering, UI components, and cross-platform support.

The goal of Catalyst is to offer developers a powerful yet easy-to-use toolkit for building visually rich applications. Whether you're creating games, simulations, desktop applications, or data visualization tools, Catalyst has you covered.

## Features

- High-performance 2D and 3D rendering
- Easy-to-use UI components
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Requirements

Catalyst is written against C++23 and needs two features that are only just becoming widely
available: deducing this and `std::expected`.

| Toolchain | Status |
| --- | --- |
| GCC 14 or newer | Supported |
| Clang 19 or newer, with libstdc++ 14+ | Supported |
| MSVC 19.40 or newer (Visual Studio 2022 17.10+) | Supported |
| GCC 13 | No deducing this. |
| Clang 18 | libstdc++ gates `<expected>` on `__cpp_concepts >= 202002L`, which Clang only reports from 19. |
| libc++ / Apple Clang / macOS | **Not yet.** libc++ leaves the floating-point `std::from_chars` overloads deleted, and the JSON and CSV parsers need them. |

CMake checks both features at configure time and stops with a readable message rather than letting
the build fail hundreds of template errors later. On Ubuntu 24.04 the default `g++` is 13 and will
not work — install `g++-14` and point CMake at it:

```bash
sudo apt install g++-14
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-14
```

CMake 3.16 or newer is required. Everything else is optional: see
[CMake Options](#cmake-options) for the module switches and
[Backend selection](#cmake-options) for what each backend needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Catalyst, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Catalyst.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
    cd Catalyst
    ```

3. Build the project using CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

4. Run the example application:

    ```bash
    ./build/examples/audio_playback/Release/catalyst_audio_playback.exe
    ```

### Multi-compiler builds (Windows)

This repo includes a root [CMakePresets.json](CMakePresets.json) so you can quickly validate builds across multiple compilers.

- List presets:

  ```bash
  cmake --list-presets
  ```

- Build MSVC (Visual Studio):

  ```bash
  cmake --preset msvc-x64
  cmake --build --preset msvc-x64-debug
  cmake --build --preset msvc-x64-release
  ```

  Note about the MSVC generator:

  - The `msvc-x64` preset uses a specific CMake *Visual Studio* generator (e.g. `Visual Studio 18 2026`).
    If your installed Visual Studio version does not match the generator in the preset, CMake may report that it
    “could not find any instance of Visual Studio”.
  - If you change the generator, you must use a fresh build directory (or run `cmake --fresh --preset msvc-x64`) to
    avoid “generator does not match the generator used previously” errors.
  - To see which generator names are available on your machine:

    ```powershell
    cmake --help
    ```

- Build Clang-CL (Ninja):

  ```bash
  cmake --preset clangcl-x64-debug
  cmake --build --preset clangcl-x64-debug

  cmake --preset clangcl-x64-release
  cmake --build --preset clangcl-x64-release
  ```

- Build the whole matrix (script):

  ```powershell
  ./scripts/build-all-presets.ps1
  # or: ./scripts/build-all-presets.ps1 -Config Debug
  # or: ./scripts/build-all-presets.ps1 -Config Release
  ```

### Test presets

Test-enabled configure/build presets are provided with the `-tests` suffix.

- Build + run tests (Windows):

  ```powershell
  ./scripts/build-all-presets.ps1 -Tests -RunTests
  ```

- Or run a specific test preset directly:

  ```bash
  # after building one of the *-tests build presets
  ctest --preset clangcl-x64-debug-tests
  ```

### Cross-platform presets (Linux/macOS)

Presets are included for Linux (GCC/Clang) and macOS (Clang). These use the Ninja generator.
On each host OS, only the relevant presets are shown (Windows won’t list Linux/macOS presets, etc.).

Examples:

```bash
cmake --preset linux-gcc-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-gcc-debug

cmake --preset macos-clang-release-tests
cmake --build --preset macos-clang-release-tests
ctest --preset macos-clang-release-tests
```

### Build-all scripts

Scripts are provided to auto-run all *available* presets on the current host:

- Windows: [scripts/build-all-available-presets.ps1](scripts/build-all-available-presets.ps1)
  - Build: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets.ps1`
  - Build + test: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets.ps1 -RunTests`
- Linux: [scripts/build-all-available-presets-linux.sh](scripts/build-all-available-presets-linux.sh)
  - Build: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets-linux.sh`
  - Build + test: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets-linux.sh --run-tests`
- macOS: [scripts/build-all-available-presets-macos.sh](scripts/build-all-available-presets-macos.sh)
  - Build: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets-macos.sh`
  - Build + test: `./scripts/build-all-available-presets-macos.sh --run-tests`

Linux/macOS wrappers call the shared runner: [scripts/build-all-available-presets.py](scripts/build-all-available-presets.py)

Note: on Linux/macOS you may need to set the executable bit once:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build-all-available-presets-linux.sh scripts/build-all-available-presets-macos.sh
```

## CMake Options

Catalyst is modular: you can link individual modules, or link the monolithic umbrella library.

- **Monolithic**: `CATALYST_BUILD_ALL` (default: `ON`)
  - Builds the `catalyst` target (aliases: `catalyst::catalyst`, `catalyst::all`) which links all enabled modules.
- **Modules** (all default to `ON`): `CATALYST_BUILD_ANIMATION`, `CATALYST_BUILD_AUDIO`,
  `CATALYST_BUILD_CORE`, `CATALYST_BUILD_EVENTS`, `CATALYST_BUILD_INPUT`, `CATALYST_BUILD_LOGGING`,
  `CATALYST_BUILD_MATH`, `CATALYST_BUILD_NET`, `CATALYST_BUILD_PHYSICS`, `CATALYST_BUILD_PLATFORM`,
  `CATALYST_BUILD_RENDERING`, `CATALYST_BUILD_RESOURCE`, `CATALYST_BUILD_SCENE`,
  `CATALYST_BUILD_TEXT`, `CATALYST_BUILD_UI`, `CATALYST_BUILD_UTILS`
- **Extras**:
  - `CATALYST_BUILD_EXAMPLES` (default: `ON`)
  - `CATALYST_BUILD_TESTS` (default: `ON`)
  - `CATALYST_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` (default: `ON`)
  - `CATALYST_RESOURCE_STB` (default: `ON`) — fetches stb_image at a pinned commit for the source-format
    image decoders. `OFF` makes the resource module dependency-free; `load_image` then reports
    `unsupported_format` for PNG, JPEG and friends but still reads cooked KTX2 and DDS containers.
  - `CATALYST_LOG_COMPILED_LEVEL` (default: `trace`) — the floor below which `catalyst::logging` calls are
    compiled out entirely. One of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `critical`.

- **Backend selection**:
  - `CATALYST_INPUT_BACKEND` (default: `auto`) values: `auto`, `win32`, `null`
  - `CATALYST_AUDIO_BACKEND` (default: `auto`) values: `auto`, `win32`, `null`
  - `CATALYST_PLATFORM_BACKEND` (default: `auto`) values: `auto`, `win32`, `null`
  - `CATALYST_RENDERING_BACKEND` (default: `auto`) values: `auto`, `d3d12`, `vulkan`, `null`
    - `auto` prefers Vulkan and falls back to `null` when no Vulkan SDK is present, so a fresh clone always
      configures. CMake prints which one it picked. The `null` backend records state and draws nothing — if you
      wanted a renderer that draws, install a Vulkan SDK and reconfigure.
    - `vulkan` needs a Vulkan SDK (1.3 or newer) that CMake's `find_package(Vulkan)` can locate, e.g. via the
      `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable, and a driver exposing Vulkan 1.3. Naming it explicitly makes a missing
      SDK an error rather than a fallback. Shaders are consumed as SPIR-V; the SPIR-V is committed, and
      `scripts/embed_spirv.py` regenerates it with `glslc` after a shader change.
    - `d3d12` is an identity stub whose resource layer is the `null` bookkeeping implementation: it records state
      and draws nothing. It stays opt-in until it is real.

Example: build only a subset of modules (no monolithic target):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
    -DCATALYST_BUILD_ALL=OFF \
    -DCATALYST_BUILD_RENDERING=ON \
    -DCATALYST_BUILD_UI=OFF \
    -DCATALYST_BUILD_CORE=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Example: build monolithic Catalyst without networking:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCATALYST_BUILD_NET=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Example: force specific backends:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCATALYST_INPUT_BACKEND=win32 \
  -DCATALYST_AUDIO_BACKEND=win32 \
  -DCATALYST_PLATFORM_BACKEND=win32 \
  -DCATALYST_RENDERING_BACKEND=d3d12
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Installing and consuming

Catalyst installs, and exports a CMake package, so it does not have to be an `add_subdirectory` of
your tree:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/you/want/it
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

Then, from another project — every module is a component:

```cmake
find_package(Catalyst 0.1 REQUIRED COMPONENTS audio rendering math)

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE catalyst::audio catalyst::rendering catalyst::math)
```

Asking for a module the install was not built with is an error naming what is missing and what the
install does contain, rather than a link failure later. `find_package` also sets `CATALYST_MODULES`
and `CATALYST_RENDERING_BACKEND_NAME` so a build can branch on either.

## Includes

- Include everything this build contains (umbrella header):
  - `#include <catalyst/catalyst.hpp>`
- Include only a module:
  - `#include <catalyst/rendering/rendering.hpp>`
  - `#include <catalyst/audio/audio.hpp>`

### `<catalyst/config.hpp>`

Generated at configure time, and the way to ask what a given build of Catalyst contains:

```cpp
#include <catalyst/config.hpp>

#if CATALYST_HAS_AUDIO
#  include <catalyst/audio/audio.hpp>
#endif

static_assert(CATALYST_VERSION >= CATALYST_VERSION_ENCODE(0, 1, 0));
```

It defines `CATALYST_HAS_<MODULE>` for all sixteen modules, `CATALYST_VERSION_MAJOR` / `_MINOR` /
`_PATCH` / `_STRING`, the comparable `CATALYST_VERSION` with `CATALYST_VERSION_ENCODE`,
`CATALYST_RENDERING_BACKEND_NAME` (resolved, never `"auto"`) and `CATALYST_HAS_STB_IMAGE`. The
umbrella header uses these to include only what was actually built.

### Namespaces

Everything lives under `catalyst::`, including the math library — `catalyst::math::vec3f`. If you
want the shorter spelling in a translation unit dense with vector maths, ask for it explicitly:

```cpp
#include <catalyst/math/alias.hpp>   // namespace math = catalyst::math;

math::vec3f up{0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f};
```

Never include that header from a public header of your own: a namespace alias at global scope
reaches everything that includes it, transitively.

## Components

Catalyst is composed of several key components that can be used independently or together:

- **Renderer**: Handles all rendering operations, supporting both 2D and 3D graphics.
- **UI System**: A retained tree of styled nodes with CSS-like units and a flexbox layout engine, emitting a backend-agnostic draw list. See [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md) for the architecture and roadmap.
- **Input Handling**: Layout-independent keyboard events, text input, mouse (including raw motion and cursor capture) and gamepads, with an event stream and a polled `input_state` view.
- **Math Library**: Offers a collection of mathematical functions and data structures commonly used in graphics programming.
- **Utilities**: A set of helper functions and classes to simplify common tasks.
- **Platform Abstraction**: Ensures compatibility across different operating systems and hardware.
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently loads and manages assets such as textures, models, and shaders.
- **Scene Graph**: Organizes and manages the hierarchical structure of objects in a scene.
- **Animation System**: Provides tools for creating and managing animations for objects within the framework.
- **Networking Module**: Enables network communication for multiplayer applications or data synchronization.
- **Audio System**: Supports audio playback and manipulation for immersive experiences.
- **Scripting Support**: Integrates scripting languages for dynamic behavior and rapid prototyping.
- **Physics Engine**: Offers basic physics simulation capabilities for realistic object interactions.
- **Plugin System**: Allows for easy extension of the framework through plugins.
- **Debugging Tools**: Includes tools for profiling and debugging applications built with Catalyst.
- **Documentation Generator**: Facilitates the creation of documentation for projects using Catalyst.
- **Testing Framework**: Provides a suite of tools for unit testing and integration testing of applications.
