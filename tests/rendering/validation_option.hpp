 * @brief Opt-in Vulkan validation for the rendering tests, driven by `CATALYST_RENDERING_VALIDATION`.
 * @details The tiers that touch synchronisation - pools reset while the GPU might still be reading
 * them, transfers submitted on a queue family other than the one that will read the result - are
 * exactly the ones whose mistakes a functional test cannot see. The bytes come out right; the
 * validation layer is what says the program had no right to expect that.
 *
 * So it is switchable rather than always on: the layers are a developer-machine dependency and cost
 * a large multiple of the runtime, and a test suite that failed on a machine without them installed
 * would be worse than one that quietly does less. Set `CATALYST_RENDERING_VALIDATION=1` and any
 * complaint the layer makes arrives on the console through the module's own logging, at the level
 * the layer assigned it.
