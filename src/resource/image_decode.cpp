 * @brief @ref catalyst::resource::load_image -- the container sniff that picks a reader, the
 * optional mip pass after it, and the `loader<image>` specialisation that puts both behind
 * `load<image>`.
 * @details There is one public entry point for decoding an image and it does not take a format
 * argument. A caller that had to name the container would have to sniff it first, and every caller
 * would sniff it slightly differently; worse, a cooked pipeline that swaps a PNG for a KTX2 would
 * then be a change at every call site instead of a change to a file on disk.
 *
 * The readers themselves are in image_stb.cpp, image_ktx2.cpp and image_dds.cpp. Only the first is
 * touched by `CATALYST_RESOURCE_STB`; see detail/image_codec.hpp.
