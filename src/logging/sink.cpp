/**
 * @file sink.cpp
 * @brief Implements `scoped_sink`, the only part of sink.hpp that is not a type-level declaration.
 * @details It lives here rather than in router.cpp because the guard is part of what a sink is -
 * the answer to "this sink is going away, stop logging to it" - and because it needs the router's
 * definition, which sink.hpp deliberately does not have.
