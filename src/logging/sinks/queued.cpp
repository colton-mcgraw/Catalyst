/**
 * @file queued.cpp
 * @brief Implements the owner-drained sink declared in queued.hpp.
 * @details One lock covers the ring and the counters, and is held only for as long as it takes to
 * copy an event in or move one out. The inner sink is never called under it: `drain` takes an event,
 * drops the lock, delivers, and takes the lock again, so a slow inner sink does not stop logging
 * threads from queueing behind it.
 *
 * A second lock covers delivery itself. Draining from two threads at once is a mistake, but it is a
 * mistake that would otherwise show up as corruption inside the user's sink rather than as the
 * serialisation they assumed they had.
