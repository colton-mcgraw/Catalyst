 * @brief Internal header of the Vulkan rendering backend: the per-resource state records, the id registry and the
 * helpers shared between the translation units that implement src/rendering/detail_backend.hpp on top of Vulkan 1.3.
 * @details Design in one paragraph so the individual files make sense:
 *   - One `VkInstance` + `VkDevice` per `device`, with up to three queues taken from distinct families.
 *   - Render passes use dynamic rendering (core 1.3): no VkRenderPass / VkFramebuffer objects.
 *   - Image layouts follow a fixed invariant instead of being tracked: user textures always sit in
 *     `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL`, presentable swapchain images in `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR` outside a render
 *     pass and `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` inside one. Hazards are covered by a conservative full barrier before each
 *     render pass, dispatch and copy.
 *   - Resource binding uses one pipeline layout for every pipeline with four descriptor sets: uniform buffers (set 0),
 *     storage buffers (set 1), sampled textures (set 2) and samplers (set 3); the public `slot` is the binding index.
 *     Sets are partially bound, so unbound slots are simply not written. 128 bytes of push constants are visible to all
 *     stages.
 *   - Three queues - graphics, compute, copy - taken from distinct families where the adapter has them and aliased
 *     onto graphics where it does not. Each has its own timeline semaphore, whose value is what a public
 *     `timeline_point` names. Destroying a resource while work is in flight defers the Vulkan release until every
 *     queue has passed the value it stood at when the destruction was asked for.
 *   - Transfers are asynchronous. Uploads are staged into a ring (`staging_ring`), recorded into a transfer command
 *     buffer and submitted on the copy queue; nothing waits. The "immediate" command buffer survives only for the two
 *     places that genuinely have to be synchronous - swapchain image setup, and teardown.
 *   - Buffers and images are created with `VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT` across the distinct queue families when the
 *     adapter has more than one. Exclusive sharing would require an explicit ownership transfer every time a resource
 *     crossed engines, which nothing here tracks; concurrent is the correct-by-construction choice for a backend whose
 *     hazard model is still one full barrier per pass. Tier 6's explicit resource states is where that gets narrowed.
 *   - Buffers, images and command lists are looked up through one process-wide registry. It is not internally
 *     synchronised: the public API layer holds the module lock (src/rendering/detail_sync.hpp) across every call into
 *     this backend, shared for reads and recording, exclusive for creation, destruction and submission. See
 *     src/rendering/detail_backend.hpp for what a backend may assume.
 * Not part of the public API.
