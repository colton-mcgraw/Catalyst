 * @brief Public timeline API: querying and waiting on a `timeline_point`, parking coroutines on
 * one, and `pump`, which resumes them.
 * @details The park list is deliberately here rather than in a backend. What a backend knows is how
 * to compare a timeline value against the GPU's progress; who is waiting for that value, and on
 * which thread they should wake up, is the same answer on every backend and belongs on this side of
 * the seam.
 *
 * The list is global rather than per device because a `timeline_point` carries its device with it,
 * so a single vector keyed by nothing at all is enough, and a device with no parked continuations
 * costs one empty-vector check in `pump`. It is guarded by a mutex: `co_await` may be reached from
 * whatever thread a task happens to be running on, even while the device itself is still
 * single-threaded, and that is exactly the case a lock is cheap insurance for.
