         * shortest interval Windows accepts and its real resolution is finer still on a system where something has raised
         * the timer frequency, so an ungated callback can be entered several hundred times a second while the user drags a

         * rare as it should be.

         * The gate deliberately stops at a rate cap and does not also wait on the compositor (DwmFlush). Waiting for vsync
         * is the presenting code's job, and every graphics API offers it; doing it here as well would make an application
         * that already presents with vsync enabled run a resize drag at half its refresh rate, since each frame would wait
         * out two display periods instead of one.
         *
         * The callback is allowed to do almost anything, including publishing events and destroying its own window, so the
