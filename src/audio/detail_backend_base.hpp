/**
 * @file detail_backend_base.hpp
 * @brief The state and reporting every live backend has, so that a backend only has to contain the
 * part of itself that is actually about its platform API.
 * @details The `backend` interface in detail_backend.hpp says what a backend must answer; it says
 * nothing about how, and each backend used to answer the easy two thirds of it the same way, from
 * the same six members. WASAPI and ASIO had separate, character-for-character identical
 * `is_running`, `stats`, `reset_stats`, `take_xruns` and `failure` - and ASIO, having no copy of
 * WASAPI's `take_failure`, silently had no way to report that its driver had died at all.
 *
 * This base holds those members once. What remains in a backend is device selection, format
 * negotiation and the render path: the things that genuinely differ between WASAPI's COM endpoints,
 * ASIO's driver callbacks and the null backend's nothing.
 *
 * The one subtlety is @ref notice_publisher. A platform can notify us that a device vanished from a
 * thread we do not own, at a moment when the backend is already being torn down, so the state such
 * a notification touches cannot be the backend's own. It is held by `shared_ptr` on both sides
 * instead: teardown retires it and drops its reference, and whatever is still in flight keeps it
 * alive for exactly as long as it needs.
